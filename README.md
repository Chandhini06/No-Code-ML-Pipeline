A web-based, no-code Machine Learning pipeline builder that allows users to perform an end-to-end ML workflow — from data upload to model training — without writing a single line of code.

This project was built using Streamlit, pandas, and scikit-learn, and follows a step-based visual pipeline, inspired by tools like Orange Data Mining.

The app is designed as a simple, step-by-step ML workflow, letting users visually move through:

Data Upload → Preprocessing → Train–Test Split → Model Training → Results
